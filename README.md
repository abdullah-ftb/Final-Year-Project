The AI-Assisted Test Conducting Web Application aims to revolutionize traditional test-taking and assessment procedures by integrating artificial intelligence to automate and streamline the test creation process. The primary goal is to address inefficiencies and human errors associated with manual test preparation and execution, especially in large educational settings. The project tackles the problem of limited flexibility and scalability in current online test platforms, which lack AI-driven features for automated test generation. By incorporating AI, the platform allows examiners to generate various types of tests (MCQs, Q&A, coding tasks) based on uploaded study materials, improving both the accuracy and efficiency of assessments.The development process involves creating a cloud-based web application with separate portals for examiners and Applicants. Examiners can upload materials, generate tests with AI assistance, and manage student performance, while Applicants can take tests online or offline. The platform also features a robust reporting system, providing detailed insights into individual and session-level performance.Results from preliminary testing show that the AI model successfully generates accurate and relevant test questions, while users find the interface intuitive and efficient. In conclusion, the platform offers a scalable, secure, and user-friendly solution to the evolving needs of educational institutions and corporate training environments, with significant potential for global market expansion.
